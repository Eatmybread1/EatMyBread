# Hog Rider 
The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a quick building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding an oversized hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.

#Strategy

His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. However, the Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though they are vulnerable to spells.
Use this to your advantage by placing a bulky swarm dealer in front of the Hog Rider (eg. Ice Golem, Valkyrie) so that the Hog Rider can transport it to the tower faster and also get protection from swarms.
Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.
A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.
A good placement and timing with Guards and The Log will fully counter the Hog Rider, canceling all Hog hits.
The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.
However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.
Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.
It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.
In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.
Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.
When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.
Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.
Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.
If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.
For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.
For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.
They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider’s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.
The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.
A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted
A very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.
This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.
The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.
A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower.
Pairing the Hog Rider with the Balloon can deal devastating damage. If executed properly, the Hog Rider will act as a tank while the Balloon threatens to deal massive damage. The Hog Rider can also destroy any buildings attempting to slow down the combo. However, this combo is very vulnerable to swarms and anti-air cards as neither of the troops target anything but buildings. Additionally, they are easy to separate, due to the disparity in move speeds. Alternatively, the Hog Rider and the Balloon can be played in different lanes to spread the opponent's defenses thin. However, a building or Tornado can bring them back together for an easier defense.
The Hog Rider can be paired with the Lumberjack as both a swarm bait and damage combo. It is a very fast combo with an extremely high damage output potential, so the enemy will likely try to counter it with a swarm. If this happens, use a spell like Arrows to render the opponent defenseless. If they manage to defeat the Lumberjack, the dropped Rage will make the Hog Rider even more dangerous than it normally is.
A fast and deadly combination is the Hog Rider and Mini P.E.K.K.A. combo. Both units are fast but the Mini P.E.K.K.A. does much more damage and does not attack only buildings so the Mini P.E.K.K.A. can deal with troops like the Executioner and Musketeer. However, this combo can be defeated with swarms like Skeleton Army, which will defeat both of them since neither of them can deal area damage. They are also unable to target air troops, so the Minion Horde can stop this easily.
A solid play is to deploy the Hog Rider at the bridge as soon as the match starts or when you reach 10 elixir which is safer. If the opponent does not react fast enough or has a bad starting hand, the Hog Rider will deal a significant amount of damage to the Princess Tower. This can also allow the player to quickly scout the opponent's deck if they happen to react to him fast enough.

#History

The Hog Rider was added with Clash Royale's soft launch on 4/1/16.
On 3/5/16, the May 2016 Update added the level 13 Hog Rider (then level 11).
On 21/6/16, a Balance Update decreased the Hog Rider's damage by 6%.
On 12/12/17, a Balance Update decreased the Hog Rider’s hit speed to 1.6 seconds (from 1.5 seconds) and delayed his first attack by 0.1 seconds.
The 20/6/18 Update moved the Arena to unlock the Hog Rider from P.E.K.K.A's Playhouse (Arena 4) to Goblin Stadium (Arena 1).
The 2021 Quarter 2 Update moved the Arena to unlock the Hog Rider from Goblin Stadium (Arena 1) to Spell Valley (Arena 5).
On 27/10/21, the 2021 Quarter 3 Update added the level 14 Hog Rider.

#Trivia

His description is based on the Clash of Clans commercial "Ride of the Hog Riders".
The Hog Rider is based on its identical counterpart in Clash of Clans, given that both of them can jump over obstacles that normal ground units are unable to.
When the Hog Rider is deployed, he will occasionally yell "Hog Riderrrr!"
The Hog Rider is 1 of 17 troops which first existed in Clash of Clans, the others being Minions, Archers, Goblins, Barbarians, Giant, Valkyrie, Wizard, Witch, Bowler, P.E.K.K.A, Wall Breakers, Golem, Balloon, Lava Hound, Cannon Cart, and the Archer Queen.
When he is jumping over the river, he cannot be targeted by any ground attacking units. The Log and Earthquake will fail to damage a Hog Rider while he is jumping. Air troops will still attack him, and the Inferno Tower and Inferno Dragon will continue to ramp up their damage.
2 Hog Rider statues can be seen in Hog Mountain (Arena 10) behind the enemy's King's Tower.
The Hog Rider is the subject of a set of Emotes.
The Hog Rider is featured as a character skin for Carl in Brawl Stars.
He has more than a passing resemblance to "Mr. T", an American actor.
He is also a bit similar to "Zangief" in Street Fighter, as his mohawk hair and his beard looks similar to him.
The hog that he rides is most likely a warthog. Warthogs are smaller than boars but more agile which might explain why the Hog Rider can move particularly fast. Warthogs also have tusks, which is like the Hog Rider's hog in Clash Royale.
The Hog Rider is one of 5 troops to have the ability to jump over the river, the others being Ram Rider, Royal Hogs, Prince and Dark Prince.
The Mega Knight card is unlocked from Royal Arena (Arena 7) or a Legendary Chest. He is a melee-ranged splash damage troop with very high hitpoints and moderate splash damage. He appears with black spiked fists and huge armor, along with grey chainmail and a team-colored belt. When deployed, he will deal damage around enemy units around him in a 360º area around him, which deals twice the amount of damage as his regular attack. If there are ground units between 3.5 and 5 tiles of him, he will stop moving and begin charging a jump attack which takes a few seconds. The damage and area from the jump is identical to his spawn damage. However, he's still vulnerable mid-air while jumping, and unlike a mid-air Hog Rider, cards like X-Bow will remain locked on to him. A Mega Knight card costs 7 Elixir to deploy.

#Strategy

His spawn damage is similar to a Fireball, which makes him useful for quickly defeating cards with similar health to a Musketeer or Wizard. He will then only require 1 more regular attack to defeat them fully. However, the Night Witch, Witch, and Bandit have slightly more health than these units, so he will require a second swing to finish them off.
When using him to counter a reactive pack of Royal Recruits, be careful for the other side of the Recruits approaching.
The Mega Knight's high spawn damage and very high hitpoints make him nearly impossible to defeat on the opposing side, especially in lower arenas. He can get enormous value against massive pushes because of this. However, he can be countered relatively easily if alone.
The Mega Knight works well with the Inferno Dragon, as they compliment each other's weakness. Mega Knight can take out ranged glass weapons and swarms that counter the Inferno Dragon. The Inferno Dragon in turn can roast through tanks Mega Knight would struggle to deal enough damage to. However, it can be somewhat countered by air swarms so be sure to bring spells to deal with them.
A similar strategy is to combine Mega Knight & P.E.K.K.A. in a push, as they also counter each other’s weaknesses. While it can be more threatening, it is extremely expensive at 14 Elixir, often requiring that 1 of them be used on defense beforehand, which can whittle down their hitpoints. It is also even weaker to air units. You also shouldn't put two of them in the same deck for they are very expensive and you are left vulnerable to a punishment for your lack of Elixir.
One of the keys to defeating the Mega Knight is timing. To counter the Mega Knight properly, the counter unit should generally be placed no more than three tiles away from him, so that he doesn't initiate his jump attack and deal massive damage. Without it, his damage per second is somewhat low for his Elixir cost.
Using the above strategy, ground tanks like the Knight and the Valkyrie or high-damage glass cannons like the Mini P.E.K.K.A. or the Goblin Brawler are the most Elixir-efficient counters to a lone Mega Knight coming onto the defender's side of the arena. With the help of the Princess Tower, the Mega Knight will not be able to take them before they are defeated.
The only grounded tank that cannot be used in this way to counter the Mega Knight is the Ice Golem. Even if the defender attempts to kite the Mega Knight, he will still have a majority of his health left after dealing with the Ice Golem.
Similar to the Bandit, the Mega Knight will re-target onto any troop placed nearby him if his original target ends up being farther away than the newly spawned troop. If the defender is in a situation where they know they cannot prevent his jump from occurring, they can still place a cheap troop like Skeletons in front of him right before he is about to jump to soak up the damage.
However, the Mega Knight's jump mechanic is not purely identical to the Bandit's dash ability. His charge time is 0.1 seconds slower and does not make him invincible. He will still take damage while he is airborne and can be defeated mid-air. Interestingly, while in mid-air, The Log, Earthquake and Bowler will not be able to damage him, but an X-Bow or Mortar will stay locked onto an airborne Mega Knight. As a result, he counters these siege buildings well as his jump is difficult to react to at the bridge and will take out a majority of their health. He can also take care of the weaker support troops backing up the building after taking it out. Sparky and Bomber will also hit the Mega Knight even when he jumps.
The Bandit can fully counter a lone Mega Knight. By deploying her 4 tiles from the river and 3 tiles from the Princess Tower when the Mega Knight is 2 or 3 tiles from the river, she will dash at just the right time to nullify the jump damage of the Mega Knight as well as lure him into range of both Princess Towers.
the kinetic energy of the clash royale character mega khight is recorded to be 69000 J
Since the Mega Knight's damage per second without his initial jump is somewhat low, highly damaging units like the Prince or Mini P.E.K.K.A. or P.E.K.K.A can complement him well, helping him take out tanks while the Mega Knight helps deal with swarms. Air units like the Minions and the Bats also work well, but are usually vulnerable to spells.
The P.E.K.K.A. is a great counter to the Mega Knight, as her high damage per second and high hitpoints allow her to defeat the Mega Knight 1-on-1 even without a Princess Tower helping. After defending, she will have a fair amount of hitpoints remaining in case the player would like to counterpush. In the case that your opponent reveals that they have P.E.K.K.A. first, it is best to drop the Mega Knight in the other lane as it is unlikely that they will have much Elixir to counter your Mega Knight. Additionally, the Mega Knight moves much faster than the P.E.K.K.A., and is harder to distract with swarms, making the P.E.K.K.A. approaching your tower fairly easy to deal with.
The Inferno Tower and the Inferno Dragon can take out the Mega Knight as long as their ramp-up attack is uninterrupted. If they do get interrupted once, spending a bit more Elixir to deploy a distraction unit, such as an Ice Golem, will keep the Mega Knight in place and can allow either Inferno card to charge up in time again to defeat him.
Goblin Cage also can counter Mega Knight easily. Put Goblin Cage in the center of the arena and Mega Knight will destroy the cage and Goblin Brawler can defeat him because he has fast attack speed. You can also help the goblin brawler with 1 of any spirits.
The Mega Knight is helpless against air troops such as Minions and Bats, so it is best to pair him with other troops that can attack air, by using such as the Archers, the Wizard, or the Executioner.
A Zap spell will not stop the Mega Knight from jumping once his charge initiates, neither does any stun effect. The jump can only be stopped if he is defeated mid-air, by using The Log, or if the player uses other cards to pull him out of his jumping range like a Tornado. When he is already mid-jump, only the Fisherman's dragging ability can cancel its effect.
A Skeleton Army is typically not effective against the Mega Knight. In most cases, the Mega Knight will destroy the Skeleton Army even when he's surrounded due to his large splash radius. However, if he has around half of his hitpoints left, it can be effective to use the Skeleton Army on him.
However, a Skeleton Army can be useful in taking him out if you have a tank soaking up the damage for them. You can place a tank in front of Mega Knight and place a Skeleton Army behind the Mega Knight.
The Mega Knight can be used to counter a Goblin Barrel but it requires precise timing. His spawn damage can defeat all three Goblins if timed correctly — ideally, he should be deployed at the back of the Tower when the Goblin Barrel’s shadow crosses the river.
If you find this too hard to execute, you can deploy the Mega Knight between two Goblins which will prevent most of the damage dealt to your Tower. This is done by placing the Mega Knight in between the top Goblin and the one at the bottom.
The defender can use the Mega Knight's jump mechanic against him and activate their King's Tower with an Ice Spirit and Skeletons. The player should wait for the Mega Knight to approach their Princess Tower, and when he is about to jump, deploy the Ice Spirit four tiles from the King's Tower and one tile into his lane to redirect his jump. Afterwards, they should place Skeletons one tile from the King's Tower and one tile away from his lane, right before he jumps a second time. If done correctly, he will head towards the King's Tower after jumping onto the Skeletons, activating it. This will deal significant damage to the player's King's Tower however, so it is not recommended to perform this more than once.
Likewise, Tombstone can also lure the Mega Knight into activating King's Tower, given the Tombstone is deployed right in front of the King's Tower to the Mega Knight side (7-2 placement). The Mega Knight will jump closer to the Tombstone and eventually destroy it, targeting the King's Tower afterward. For a slightly more expensive, but more consistent King activation, the Tombstone can be placed higher up, such as with a placement five tiles from the river and two tiles from the Princess Tower (5-2). After its destruction, the player can place a troop that is one shot by the Mega Knight's jump close to the King's Tower.
Barbarians are an effective counter to the Mega Knight when played reactively, provided his jump is negated. They will counter him for a +2 Elixir trade. 3 of the Barbarians will survive (assuming they are the same or similar levels), demanding further response.
The Mega Knight can be a potential counter to the Sparky. If the Sparky has low enough health and is about to cross the bridge, the spawn damage from the Mega Knight might be able to knock it out. If you time it correctly, the Mega Knight will absorb the Sparky's shot and with the help of a Tower, be able to destroy the Sparky. This will leave you with a relatively high health Mega Knight to do a counter-attack with. However, if the Sparky manages to defeat the Mega Knight, then it is a negative trade of one Elixir for you.
When you suspect that your opponent is running a Mega Knight, it is not advised to clump up troops together in a small area proactively, as he will reap massive value. To play around him when proactively playing an offensive card like Royal Hogs, splitting them in the middle of the arena is always an option.
A very common mistake among players that complain about him is that they defend him with glass cannons such as the Musketeer or the Wizard without support. It is highly advised to distract him with a tank such as the Ice Golem or the Knight when you want to defend him using this route.
A Mega Knight takes five shots to defeat equally levelled Elite Barbarians, but takes six at Level 14. Be cautious.

#History

The Mega Knight was available in the Mega Knight Challenge which started on 25/8/17. In this challenge, the player would build a deck which included the Mega Knight. If the player achieved 12 wins, they would have obtained him early, and they would have been able to unlock him out of subsequent Chests before his official release.
From 31/8/17 through 4/9/17, the Shop had a special offer that Arena 10+ players can buy up to four Super Magical Chests at the normal price that had a 50% chance to contain a Mega Knight card with the first chest and a guaranteed card with the second. If a Mega Knight card is obtained in the first chest, then the second one will not guarantee it. The process is repeated with the second pair of chests.
The Mega Knight card was added to the game on 8/9/17.
On 9/10/17, the October 2017 Update fixed a bug where the Mega Knight would jump even if he was less than 4 tiles away from his target.
On 12/2/18, a Balance Update decreased both his spawn and jump damage by 25%, and reduced his deployment radius, such that he will no longer be able to hit beyond the river with his spawn damage.
On 4/6/18, a Balance Update increased both his spawn and jump damage by 23%, but also decreased his area damage by 7.5%.
On 20/6/18, a Balance Update decreased his minimum jump range to 3.5 (from 4).
On 5/11/18, a Balance Update increased his hitspeed to 1.7 seconds (from 1.8 seconds).
On 28/1/19, the January 2019 Update moved the Arena to unlock the Mega Knight from Hog Mountain (Arena 10) to Royal Arena (Arena 7).
On 1/7/19, a 'Rulebook' Update increased the Mega Knight's range from 1 to 1.2 (now classified as Melee: Medium).
On 27/10/21, the 2021 Quarter 3 Update added the level 14 Mega Knight along with other level 14 cards.

#Trivia

The Mega Knight is 1 of 15 troops that originated from Clash Royale and appear in Clash Mini, the others being Knight, Spear Goblins, Mini P.E.K.K.A., Musketeer, Dart Goblin, Battle Healer, Giant Skeleton, Prince, Guards, Miner, Ice Wizard, Electro Wizard, Magic Archer, and Lumberjack.
He, the Electro Wizard, and the Ice Wizard are the only troops that deal spawn damage. Unlike the other two, the Mega Knight's spawn damage does not affect air units, despite falling from the sky upon deployment.
The Mega Knight and Lava Hound are the most expensive Legendary cards, costing 7 Elixir.
The Italian description used to have a translation error which said that he lands with "the force of 100 mustaches".
He is one of the two troop with 3 types of attacks, the other being Ram Rider, having spawn damage and a jump attack in addition to his regular attack.
His appearance and description imply that the Mega Knight may be an "upgraded" version of a regular Knight.
The Mega Knight has the 3rd highest hitpoints out of all troops in the game, with only the Electro Giant and Golem outclassing him.
Since the description implies it lands with the force of "1,000 mustaches", it is implied that the force of one mustache deals approximately 0.537 damage at Tournament Standard.
The Mega Knight is the subject of 3 Emotes.
When the Mega Knight is defeated, his spiked fists fall to the ground. The other units that drop items upon death are the Knight, Rascal Boy, Sparky, Dark Prince, Guards, Mega Minion, Executioner, Cannon Cart, and Golden Knight.
The Miner card is unlocked from the P.E.K.K.A.'s Playhouse (Arena 4) or a Legendary Chest. He is a single-target, melee troop with both moderate hitpoints and damage that can be placed anywhere in the arena. He wears a dark grey helmet with a partially melted candle on top, carries a shovel, and has a large reddish nose and a slightly dirtied face. A Miner card costs 3 Elixir to deploy.

#Strategy

Due to his ability to be placed anywhere, the Miner can be used for surprise attacks on towers and troops.
He deals only 30% of his normal damage to Crown Towers, so it is generally not recommended to use him on them alone.
He can act as a surprise tank for high damage per second troops such as Wall Breakers. Spear Goblins or Minions, which is a cheap way to deal immense damage if ignored by the opponent. The Miner will tank the damage from the Tower or other troops while the supporting units deal chip damage. This combo can be countered by swarm troops or spells, however.
A lone Miner can deal similar damage to a Rocket for half the price to a Crown Tower if ignored, so it is generally advised to address him whenever possible and reduce the damage he deals with each push. However, if one is using a high Elixir cost deck, it may be worth ignoring a lone Miner that is used to punish one's Elixir investment, so that they have more Elixir to create a large, unstoppable push. Compared to other 3 Elixir cards, he does not deal very much damage to a Crown Tower.
The Electro Wizard works well with the Miner on offense. After the tower locks onto the Electro Wizard, a Miner can be sent in to tank for it when. The Electro Wizard's stun attacks will cause the tower to retarget onto the Miner, allowing the Electro Wizard to survive longer and deal more damage. You can also do this with the Zappies.
If the player is sending the Miner to a Princess Tower, sending the Miner on the center tile of the inner side will allow the other Princess Tower to target him. This can be helpful in that the Miner is distracting both Princess Towers, so the player can send in fast backup troops to attack both lanes. However, if the Miner is being sent in alone, it is generally not recommended to deploy him here as he will simply die more quickly and deal less damage. On the contrary, due to this interaction, this placement is very effective when one only needs a few Miner hits to take down the tower, as many players will not expect this "self-destructive" placement.
If the player deploys him in front of the tower, their supporting units are much easier to counter as splash units can easily splash the Miner and support troops. An Ice Golem can also be placed in front of tower pushing the Miner and forcing him to re-target. Due to this, it is not recommended to deploy him here, even as a surprise attack, as a unit placed far enough forward can take care of both the Miner and incoming support troops.
If one wishes to attack the King's Tower without their Miner being within range of a Princess Tower, they should place the Miner on the left corner or 1 tile beside said corner of the King's Tower to avoid getting targeted by the right Princess Tower, and vice versa. Conversely, if one wishes to attack a Princess Tower without getting targeted by the King's Tower, place him in the bottom right corner of the right Princess Tower so that he can target it without getting targeted by the King's Tower, and vice versa.
If the opponent has the Tornado card in their deck, they are able to drag the Miner to their King's Tower against many common placements, causing a King activation for an equal Elixir trade and very little Princess Tower damage. One should be aware of the two safe spots in which a Miner cannot be dragged to the King's Tower by the Tornado, those being the bottom-most tile on the non-King Tower side and the tile directly above that. Although a Miner is safe in these positions, this makes its attacks very predictable and easy to block with units as soon as the Miner is seen approaching. One may want to consider intentionally placing the Miner in a Tornado-vulnerable position and supporting him with fast, high damage units like Goblins or Bats. If the opponent is low on Elixir, they will take major damage from the supporting units should they decide to activate their King's Tower (more than they would have if they simply ignored the Miner and addressed the supporting units).
Miners can destroy enemy buildings such as spawners when they are not attacking or defending, as his damage is only reduced to Crown Towers, and will deal normal damage to other buildings. An Elixir Collector is also particularly vulnerable to Miner attacks, potentially allowing for large positive Elixir trades.
However, it is important to note that most players will attempt to protect any passive buildings placed in the back from Miner damage. Single units placed behind the Princess Tower can "catch" most Miner placements provided the defender reacts quickly enough. Cheap swarms are more lenient on this timing as they can spread out. One should either wait for the opponent's blocking unit to be out of their hand, or if the opponent uses swarms to defend him, use a spell alongside the Miner on reaction. Another strategy is to feign an attack on the building (i.e. aiming for the Princess Tower instead) in order to make the opponent waste Elixir, which can allowing for spell value on their unit, the Princess Tower, and the building.
If the opponent places their building beside their King's Tower, a high-risk, high-reward play is to send the Miner towards the back of the building, rather than the front or side. This is risky because if the opponent ignores it, the Miner will activate their King's Tower after destroying the building (which is still a positive Elixir trade, but will notably limit future Miner damage). However, if the opponent plays a card to defend a Miner in front or beside the building, the unit will waste time walking towards him and defeat him before he can get a chance to activate the King's Tower, which also results in an even larger positive Elixir trade as the opponent will have spent Elixir to deploy a unit, and would have lost the opportunity to activate the King's Tower.
The Miner should not be deployed directly above and 1 tile beside on the left (for both sides of the arena) of the Princess Tower as he will target it instead. The Miner will always attack the left corner of the targeted building.
The Tombstone is the only passive building which is not recommended to be taken down with a Miner under any circumstance. The constant Skeleton spawns make it difficult for the Miner to connect to it, and its equal Elixir cost and death spawn will deny all Miner damage even if the Miner does connect. In fact, a Tombstone is typically only placed behind a Princess Tower specifically in anticipation for Miner attacks.
It's not recommended to reel the Miner to the King's Tower with a Tornado when the Miner is at low health, as the Miner can possibly die during the spell effect, resulting in a waste of three Elixir.
When Mirroring a Miner, the Mirror will reveal its location. Due to this, it is not recommended to Mirror a Miner when using it on offense, as the Mirror's visual indicator will make it easier to block with a troop.
The player can also support their pushes by deploying the Miner next to their troops. However, the Miner is best used to tank, diverting some damage from the main push.
The Miner can be used to take early-placed opposing defenders by surprise. That way, Miner can tank for the player's main offense.
The Miner can take out squishy but powerful troops such as the Princess or Musketeer that are protected by a tank. Against a Princess that is attacking a tower from the bridge, placing him on the outside tiles will not cause her to re-target to him; the player needs to deploy the Miner on the inside or the center tile to cause her to re-target.
Being a single-target troop, the Miner is very weak against a small swarm of troops, such as Skeletons, which distract the Miner and prevent him from attacking nearby buildings. High damage troops like the Mini P.E.K.K.A. can also easily destroy the Miner.
Switching up the placement of the Miner unpredictably is highly recommended and prevents the opponent from efficiently addressing the Miner, allowing him to chip the tower constantly. Many players will start anticipating a Miner's position even after just one attack, so deploying him in the same spot twice is mostly ineffective. Another method to sneak in Miner damage is to deploy him nearby an enemy unit placed near the tower, but barely far enough so that he will not attack them. This is effective because many players will expect the Miner to be placed far away from all units so that his damage is maximised, but this ends up being predictable.
Miner pairs well with the Poison as the Poison will defeat any swarms trying to counter the Miner while the Miner does constant chip damage to the Princess Tower. The Poison, too, will chip some damage off the Tower.
The Miner has an excellent synergy with the Skeleton Barrel. The Skeleton Barrel initially tanks for the Miner, then the Miner tanks for the Skeletons from the barrel. However, this synergy is easily stopped by a spell after the Skeleton Barrel pops, so be sure to make do with bait such as Skeleton Army or better yet, those that still synergise with the Miner such as the Dart Goblin or Bats.
Pairing up the Miner and Hog Rider is a great choice for a push. However, it is vulnerable to air troops, such as Minions, and is also easily stopped by Barbarians or Skeleton Army. It is recommended to have a spell ready to support them.
If the Miner digs under a place where troops are standing, the troops above him will move aside. This uprooting of the dirt can re-aggro troops as it pushes them aside and make them switch targets. However, this is not substantially used as it is hard to predict Miner movement.
A Goblin Barrel works well with the Miner. The Miner can soak up damage, while the Goblins deal damage, and vice versa. However, this combo is very vulnerable to spells. Deploying a Miner alongside the Barrel may simply allow the opponent to damage the miner for "free". Another way to use this combo is to deploy the Goblin Barrel on one Princess Tower and the Miner on the other. This is especially effective if the Miner is tanking for both towers, which can allow the Goblins to sneak damage in if they are not one-shot by a spell.
The Miner also works very well with the Graveyard. The Miner will tank the damage from the Tower or counters while the Skeletons continuously spawn, allowing them to potentially deal heavy damage to the Tower. A Minion Horde or Poison can counter this combo for an Elixir advantage, however.
An Ice Spirit is useful as a cheap support unit when defending against the Miner. An Ice Spirit deployed behind the defending Princess Tower will, at most, only allow one Miner hit to get through before it freezes him. This gives the defender time to deploy units and force the Miner to retarget onto them.
The Miner can be pushed back by The Log while underground. However, The Log will not deal any damage to the Miner and will not cause it to pop out of the ground upon contact. As such, the player should not commonly rely on this tactic.
